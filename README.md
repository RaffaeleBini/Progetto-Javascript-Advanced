# Javascript Advanced Project: Book Search App
Application for searching books in the "Open Library" catalogue, developed as the final project of the Javascript Advanced course in Start2Impact. 

## How it works
The application works through a text box (Google style) which allows the user to search for books by indicating a specific category (e.g. Fantasy).
After entering the category, the user starts the search by clicking the "Search" button; at the end of the search, the application displays the list of titles identified and their authors in te "Results" box. 
By clicking on the title of a book, the application shows the description in the "Book Details" box. 
The application also displays in the search history in the "Search History" box.
